# Project Overview

## Look for evolutionary conserved regions across orthologs:(Omri)
### A. Create orthologs MSA using Reciprocal best hit.
### B. Create for paralogs as well.
### C. Use consurf

## Folate binding pocket (After duplication) :
### A. Check for similarly structured pockets and look for interacting ligands (possible binders for the pocket)(Daniel)
- Use alphafill?

### B. Check for similarly structured ligands to folic acid and dock it to the pocket (Hagai)
